    "A [recent paper of mine](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11686) proposed an algorithm to do weakly-supervised inverse RL from goal states (check out the paper!). The algorithm is derived through an interesting framework called \"control as inference\", which analogizes (max-ent) reinforcement learning as inference in a graphical model. This framework has been gaining traction recently, and it's been used to justify many recent contributions in IRL ([Finn et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00448), [Fu et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248)), and some interesting RL algorithms like Soft Q-Learning([Haarnoja et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08165)). \n",

    "I personally think the framework is very cute, and it's an interesting paradigm which can explain some weird quirks that show up in RL. This document is a writeup which explains exactly what \"control as inference\" is.
