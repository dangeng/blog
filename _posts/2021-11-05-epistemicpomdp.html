title: "Why Generalization in RL is Difficult: Epistemic POMDPs and Implicit Partial Observability"
tagline: "Understanding why generalization in <b> fully-observed</b> RL domains requires us to solve <b> partially-observed</b> RL problems"
description: "A lot of empirical evidence has shown that generalization in RL is hard in practice, but is this an issue with our implementations or something more fundamental? This blog post explores one reason why generalization in RL is fundamentally hard: it turns fully-observed RL problems into more challenging partially-observed ones."
